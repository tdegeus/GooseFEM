Overview
--------

This header-only module provides C++ classes (including Python wrappers) to write simulations using the Finite Element Method.

.. note::

  This library is free to use under the `GPLv3 license <https://github.com/tdegeus/GooseFEM/blob/master/LICENSE>`_. Any additions are very much appreciated, in terms of suggested functionality, code, documentation, testimonials, word of mouth advertisement, .... Bugs or feature requests can be filed on `GitHub <http://github.com/tdegeus/GooseFEM>`_. As always, the code comes with no guarantee. None of the developers can be held responsible for possible mistakes.

Hallmark feature
----------------

The hallmark feature of GooseFEM is that data is not stored in GooseFEM's classes but in multi-dimensional arrays with certain storage conventions. Consequently one is entirely free to mix and match routines, from GooseFEM or even from somewhere else.

This design choice also has resulted in a very simple library: As very little problem specific information is needed all classes are transparent single functionality classes.

Documentation
-------------

This document should be considered as a quick-start guide. A lot effort has been spent on the readability of the code itself (in particular the ``*.h`` files should be instructive). One is highly encouraged to answer more advanced questions that arise from this guide directly using the code. Download buttons to the relevant files are included throughout this reader.

A compact reader covering the basic theory is available `here <https://github.com/tdegeus/GooseFEM/docs/theory/readme.pdf>`_.
